      <h3>Illustrator & Grahpic/Web Designer</h3>
      <p>Hello! I am Krista, otherwise known as Jynxx-Chan on my socials.<br> I am a self taught
        illustrator and I am currently taking graphic design courses.
        I am a proud cat mom of three, with a big love for animals and nature.
        I have been interested in the arts for as long as I can remember. I started my
        journey redrawing Ed Hardy tattoos you could get from the little coin machines
        at the grocery store. After that I really got into anime which has led my art to
        where it is now.
